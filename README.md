# CMS1500-Claim-Form-Reader
This script is designed to read and extract text from a CMS-1500 form (Health Insurance Claim Form) PDF file. The extracted text can then be used to integrate the form details into other tools such as Reflection or Facets, which may not capture the form details correctly.
